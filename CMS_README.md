## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
The CMS uses MongoDB collections:
- `cms_content` - Main content storage
- `cms_media_assets` - Media files metadata
- `cms_media_folders` - Media organization

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` includes:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
```

### 3. Migration (Optional)
To migrate existing product content sections to the new CMS:

```bash
# Dry run (recommended first)
npm run migrate-cms

# Live migration
npm run migrate-cms:live

# Rollback if needed
npm run migrate-cms:rollback
```

### 4. Usage

#### Creating a New Page
1. Navigate to `/cms/pages`
2. Click "New Page"
3. Fill in basic information
4. Click "Create Page"
5. Use the block editor to build content

#### Adding Content Blocks
1. Click "Add Block" in the editor
2. Choose from available block types
3. Configure block content and settings
4. Use drag handles to reorder blocks

#### Publishing Content
1. Use the "Publish" dropdown in the editor
2. Publish immediately or schedule for later
3. Monitor status in the pages list

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adding New Block Types

1. **Create Block Component**
```tsx
// src/components/cms/blocks/MyBlock.tsx
export function MyBlock({ content, isEditing }: BlockProps) {
  // Block rendering logic
}
```

2. **Define Content Interface**
```tsx
// src/types/cms.ts
interface MyBlockContent {
  title: string
  description: string
}
```

3. **Register Block Type**
```tsx
// src/lib/cms/blocks.ts
blockRegistry['my-block'] = {
  type: 'my-block',
  name: 'My Block',
  component: MyBlock,
  // ... other properties
}
```

### Extending the API
Add new endpoints in `src/app/api/cms/` following the existing patterns.

### Custom Styling
Blocks inherit from the design system. Use CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` for consistent theming.
